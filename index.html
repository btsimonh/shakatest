    <h1>Test of seek backwards in shaka player.</h1>
    <p>Seek to ~1m by clicking in the timeline.  Then seek bwd by 1s increments (arrow left).  When you get to the start of the loaded buffers, the video will stop updating and the player will not load new data until the new seek point is smallGapLimit before the time of the last loaded first buffer</p>
    <br/>
    <p>To force easy and obvious reproduction:</p>
    <p>for 10 second segments, I have set smallGapLimit to an unreasonably large 9s</p>
    <p>for 2 second segments, I have set smallGapLimit to an unreasonably large 1.8s</p>
