    <h1>Test of seek backwards in shaka player.</h1>
    <p>Serve from a local server, e.g. 'web server for chrome'</p>
    <p>Direct playback from Github seems to work, but locally served 10s segments, using 'Bad Reverse' stalls immediately, and ir pause then 'Bad Reverse', at 40s (when it needs to load a new segment going backwards)</p>
    <p>What it seems to do is go into a 'clear buffers' frenzy.  Since it does not fail for remote serving, it is likely a time race condition.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>'Good Reverse' avoids the issue by NOT seeking if either (video or audio) of the mediastate.performingUpdate is true</p>
    <p>2 second segments also seem to work better than 10</p>
